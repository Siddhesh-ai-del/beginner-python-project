# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Project

This is a simple command-line implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic encryption technique used to encode and decode messages by shifting the letters in the alphabet.

## 📌 What It Does

- Encrypts text by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
- Decrypts text by shifting letters backward.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (like spaces and punctuation).
- Lets users run multiple operations without restarting the program.

## 🧠 How Caesar Cipher Works

The Caesar Cipher works by replacing each letter in the message with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Example:
Original: hello
Shift: +3
Result: khoor
