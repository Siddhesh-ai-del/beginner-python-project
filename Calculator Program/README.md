# 🏆 Secret Auction Program (Highest Bidder)

This is a **command-line auction app** built with Python, where multiple users can place secret bids, and the program reveals the highest bidder at the end. Inspired by the classic "Silent Auction" style — fair, simple, and no cheating!

## 🎯 What It Does

- Accepts name and bid amount from each participant
- Stores all bids privately using a dictionary
- Clears the screen after each entry (simulated)

- Built as part of my Day 9 progress from the Python Bootcamp
